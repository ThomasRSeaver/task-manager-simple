# task-manager-simple

We want to create a project which gives the user a quiz. They will start with a certain amount of money, and for each question they get right the money doubles. After each question they get right, they can choose to withdraw or keep going. If they get a question wrong they lose all their money and the game ends.

Our team has the following members:
